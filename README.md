# Todo List

The objective of this project was to learn the key concepts of the Nest framework
in order to develop complete and well-structured APIs. To achieve this,
I created a simple to-do list application that incorporates the following topics:

- TypeScript;
- Express type definition file (express.d.ts);
- Environment variables;
- Modules, controllers, and services;
- Dependency injection;
- DTOs, guards, and interceptors;
- HTTP exception classes;
- Data validation using pipes together with the class-validator and
  class-transformer packages;
- Decorators and custom decorators;
- Database management with TypeORM;
- Authentication and authorization with JWT;
- Object serialization when returning sensitive data to the client;

This project is connected to the [next-todo-list](https://github.com/joao-faust/next-todo-list) repository.
